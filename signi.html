        <h2>Why Addressing Climate Change Matters</h2>
        <p>Climate change is one of the most urgent issues of our time. In the Philippines, rising sea levels, stronger typhoons, and unpredictable weather patterns 
            threaten both rural and urban communities. According to the Climate Risk Index, the Philippines ranks among the world’s most vulnerable nations, 
            with millions of Filipinos at risk every year from climate-related disasters.</p>

        <p>Promoting a greener lifestyle is not only an environmental concern, it is a survival strategy. 
            From reducing waste to conserving energy, small actions create a ripple effect that helps build sustainable communities. 
            As the saying goes, <i>“We do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.”</i></p>

            <h3>The Role of Awareness</h3>
            <p>Awareness is the first step toward action. Many people underestimate the long-term impact of their daily habits, 
               yet studies show that communities with strong environmental education are more resilient to disasters. 
               Our website is designed to be a hub of knowledge, helping individuals understand the gravity of the problem while 
               equipping them with practical solutions.</p>
